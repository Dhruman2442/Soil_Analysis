# Soil_Analysis
A method to categorize soil types and predict their quality for certain agricultural crops using image processing and deep neural networks.
Soil Analysis using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and TF.Sort
# Introduction
This project is aimed at analyzing soil samples using image processing techniques implemented in OpenCV and machine learning using TensorFlow and TF.Sort. The goal is to classify the soil samples into different categories based on their physical and chemical properties.

# Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following:

Python 3.6 or above
OpenCV 4.5 or above
TensorFlow 2.4 or above
TF.Sort 0.3 or above
Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries
Installation
Install Python 3.6 or above
Install OpenCV using pip install opencv-python
Install TensorFlow using pip install tensorflow
Install TF.Sort using pip install tf-sort
Install Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries using pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

# Usage
To use this project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the soil_analysis.py file in your preferred text editor.
Modify the code according to your requirements.
Run the soil_analysis.py file using the command python soil_analysis.py.
Code Overview
The soil_analysis.py file contains the code for the following tasks:

# Image processing using OpenCV
Feature extraction using TensorFlow
Classification using TF.Sort
The code first reads the soil sample images using OpenCV and applies various image processing techniques such as image thresholding and edge detection to extract the features. These features are then passed through a pre-trained TensorFlow model to extract the feature vectors.

These feature vectors are then passed through the TF.Sort classification algorithm to classify the soil samples into different categories.
